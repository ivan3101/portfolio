        In my time as a Web Developer, I learned a variety of Computational
        Languages, Libraries, Frameworks, Databases and Tools. Iâ€™m specialized
        in JavaScript and use it for both, Front-end and Back-end development.
        In Front-end I find myself mostly using ReactJS, and ExpressJS for the
        Back-end.
